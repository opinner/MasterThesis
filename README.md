# This the python code corresponding to my Master's Thesis 

right now the code is still mostly unorganized and not yet sufficent commented. I will hopefully add that in the next few weeks.


The most important programs are:

- mss_functions.py *basic functions used in the other programs*
- mss_analysis.py *loads, cleans  and bins the data and saves them as a npz object*
- mss_bin_transect_flux *calculates and plots the oxygen flux trough a small band around the halocline*
- look_up_table.py *calculates from the O<sub>2</sub> fluxes, the oxygen import into the whole Eastern Gotland Basin*
- mss_quiver.plot.py *creates depiction of the fluxes in multiple denisty bands along the transect as a quiver plot*
